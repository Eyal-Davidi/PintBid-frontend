<a id="goal"></a>
## üéØ Goal
This website got developed by our group, for FH Technikum Wien, as part of the Backend Web Engineering course.

<a id="introduction"></a>
## üìù Introduction

This is the Frontend side of the PintBid website. It connects to the Backend side to display a platform for alcoholic drinks auctions. Users can create auctions to sell their products and bid in auctions to buy products. Users can register, log in, and log out from the site. The authorization gets handled using JWT tokens. The site separates observers, users, and admins to allow different options depending on their roles.

<a id="installation"></a>
## üì• Installation

in your local visual studio code use the npm package manager for installation:

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production, and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run build 
npm run serve
```
It will start the frontend implementation on port: http://localhost:8081 {has to be 8081!}


<a id="database"></a>
## üìä Database 
1. open the h2 database console on http://localhost:8080/h2-ui/ and sign in with credential su and without password
2. check if there are ROLES in the ROLES table and if not, insert them:
```
SELECT * FROM ROLES
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_USER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_OBSERVER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');
```

3. check if there are 2 users in USERS TABLE and if not, insert them via postman {it will automatically match the role to the user in many to many table USER_ROLES}:
```
url: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup

    "firstname":"John",
    "lastname":"Lenon",
    "username":"johnUser",
    "email":"john@john.com",
    "password":"12345678",
    "role":["user"]
}
```
and second user:

    "username":"willAdmin",
    "email":"will@will.com",
    "password":"12345678",
