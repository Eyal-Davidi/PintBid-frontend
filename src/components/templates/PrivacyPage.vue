              Privacy Statement - PintBid
            </h3>
            <strong>Who is responsible for the collection of data on pintbid.at?</strong>
            <br />
            PintBid platform a.s. is responsible for the data collection and storage. Our
            contact data can be found in the Imprint.
            <br />
            <strong>How do we collect your data?</strong>
            <br />
            Primarily we collect data that you consciously give to us, f.ex. with
            subscribing to our newsletter, by sending us an e-mail to get your project
            added or by booking a package to feature your project.
            <br />
            Other data will be automatically collected when you visit pintbid.at These are
            mainly technical data like your browser, OS or the time of your visit. This
            happens automatically and helps us to see how we can improve our site. These
            data will never be linked to your personal data.
            <br />
            To keep bindbit.at alive, we also use Affiliate & Ad Services, that may store
            the timestamp of your visit, your IP-address and a cookie. How do we use your
            data? We use statistics to further develop our website and to make sure to be
            able to deliver it without issue. Your e-mail address will only be used to
            answer your questions, send you our newsletter (if you consciously signed up
            for it). Your personal and company data will only be used to create an invoice
            for purchased feature packages or provide the purchased services. Some data
            will be processed by Third Parties. This is limited to our Newsletter Provider
            MailChimp (see 2 below), the tools we use to handle the purchase of feature
            packages (TypeForm and Stripe, see 1 below) and our Webspace Provider (Digital
            Ocean, see 1 below). We only share necessary data to provide a specific
            service with those parties (f.ex. only your e-mail address to send you a
            newsletter). We will not share your data with any other third parties and we
            won't use it for anything else ourselves. If you personally write us an
            e-mail, your address will be handled only by us, confidentially.
